# Gradle Demos And Slides


This repo contains the source code for the examples used during my *Buzz About Gradle* presentation. The slides can also be found in the *slides* folder.

### Download

The easiest way to download everything is to run the following command in the *terminal*:

```bash


$ git clone https://github.com/gmale/GradleDemosAndSlides.git

```

Of course, this requires having [git](http://git-scm.com) installed. The best way to get that on Mac OS X is through [homebrew](http://brew.sh/). [This video claims to describe the process](http://vimeo.com/14649488). I haven't actually watched it but getting it all working is very easy on a Mac. Unfortunately, I can't speak for Windows.
